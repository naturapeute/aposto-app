## Dependencies

To run the Aposto Web application on your machine, you need:

* `node.js` _([download link](https://nodejs.org/en/))_. After the installation, check that `node` and `npm` are properly installed by running in the terminal of your choice `node -v` and `npm -v`. Each command should display the `node` and `npm` installed version.

And that's it! The project will install all the node.js module dependencies itself on the next step. ðŸ¤™

## Quick start

In the terminal of your choice, go through the following steps:

* Install the project: `npm install` _â†’ It installs all the needed node.js modules._
**Note:** You only have to run this command the first time.
* Start the project: `npm run dev` _â†’ It launches the Web application._

You're done! The Web Application is now accessible on http://localhost:5000/. ðŸš€

## Building the application

Then, you can build the Web application by simply running `npm run build`.

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`.

## Deploying the application

```bash
